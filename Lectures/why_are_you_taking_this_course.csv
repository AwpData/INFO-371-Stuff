want to have a deeper understanding and practice on data science & machine learning
I was very interested in the real-world applications we focused on in INFO 370. I want to expand my knowledge on these topics.
I am very eager to continue exploring the field of machine learning and want to enhance my professional skills in this area.
"I used data science principles heavily in my internship this summer. Although I have only taken INFO 370, my skillset was sought after by many industry professionals on my team. Advanced data literacy is a big attraction to many hiring managers and high-functioning teams. "
I wanted to dive deeper into data science topics.
"I plan on getting my Masters in Data Science, Statistics, or Artificial Intelligence after graduating. From there I hope to be a data scientist for the first couple of years when working and then work my way up to a ML engineer so it's definitely import to learn the topic covered in this class."
wanted to learn more about data analysis
I am interested in growing my data science skills so I am well versed in different tools and methods to tackle messy and tough data. I really want to be able to apply these skills to diverse contexts.
Machine Learning seems really cool and any ways of using statistics will probably be useful in my prospective futures. 
I want to strengthen my technical and problem-solving skills to pursue a career in data science.
give me more understanding regarding data science
I enjoyed INFO 370 and want to expand my knowledge on data science and Python. 
"I loved INFO 370 with Ott and greatly enjoy statistics, and thus hoped to continue my exploration of those topics in this course."
"from the course description and taken 370, I think this series is more application and methodology, this will be more useful generally for physics or stem subject I major in."
I'm interested in Data Science and working in AI so I want to learn more.
Immplement real world analysis of data in our projects.
I'd like an understanding of the mechanics of data science beyond surface level analysis. 
I want to learn more about data science and learn ways I can help people. 
Graduation Requirement
"more machine learning and regression, and learning about neural networks "
"It is a core course for the Data Science track in Informatics.

I'm eager to further my understanding of the core data science methods, which I've laid a strong foundation in INFO 370.

I hope that the knowledge I pick up in this course will benefit my career in the long run."
I am interested in going down the Data Science path and would like to learn more about it.
I recently switched roles from my internship from a more business side of tech position to a data analyst and I would eventually like to transition into data science. I think the skills taught in this course specifically will allow me to perform beyond the duties given in the role and give me a headstart
"Data science is my current major track and future career direction, which is why I enrolled in this data science-related course. All these knowledge will be very important for me to find relevant internship opportunities and supplement my job skills."
I wanted to learn more methods to manipulate data
This class will help me with my future career as a data analyst.
It’s for my major but I want to learn more about ML
I'm interested in taking this course because it aligns with my passion for data science and machine learning. 
Want to learn about machine learning in a language I am familiar with and applications to real-world problems. I also would like to understand better how ChatGPT works and how neural networks work in general.
"Besides my data science degree requirements, I know that machine learning is a new and growing industry and having some basics down would be very helpful in finding my career path.  "
I’m interested in working with data in general so I really want to develop my analysis skills to prepare for employment.
The skills taught in this course - from machine learning to causal inference - are highly sought after in the job market. Taking this course will significantly enhance my employability in data-related roles.
I am interested in taking this course because I am interested in pursuing a possible career in data science.
"To improve the data science skills, especially ML"
"I am passionate about using data to better understand the world. This past summer, I interned in data analysis and felt proud of how I was able to apply the technical skills I learned in school to help businesses solve problems and gain insights. After graduation, I aspire to become a skilled data engineer. Data science, particularly machine learning, is a critical component of this field. Having taken CSE 416, I gained a deep appreciation for the real-world power of machine learning, and I want to continue developing in this area. That's why I enrolled in INFO 371—to deepen my knowledge of data, participate in data projects, and connect with professors, TAs, and peers who share my interests."
I'm interested in learning about more data science.
"I am interested in taking this course because I want to deepen my knowledge about Machine Learning and learn about more advanced topics I've heard of like neural networks. I have a basic foundation in AI and ML through my internship experiences, but I want to practice and learn more about them through the course.

Data Science is also my concentration in Informatics and is the career I want to pursue in the future, so taking this class is crucial in gaining some of the tools I need to make impactful contributions in my future career. I want to use the skills I gain to tackle issues like data accessibility and biases to address societal issues."
