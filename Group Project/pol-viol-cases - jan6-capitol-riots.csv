I said I need to get in there,"" Black says in the video, which is detailed in the court documents, ""So I was about to break the glass, and I thought, 'No, this is our house — we don’t act like that.' I was tempted to, I’m not gonna lie. 'Cause I’m pretty upset, you know? They stole my country.” Once inside the chamber, he says, he ""praised the name of Jesus on the Senate floor."" More than 24 hours after the insurrection, then-President Donald Trump condemned the Capitol riot and called it a ""heinous attack,"" in a video on social media.

A Facebook post of Hemphill's from December 28, 2020, read ""It's not going to be a FUN Trump rally that is planned for January 6th, it's a WAR!"" and another from January 1, 2021 announced that she was traveling to Washington, D.C. for the event, featuring a photo of her brandishing a large firearm. A YouTube video from Pam Hemphill showed footage taken at a January 5 event hosted by Alex Jones, with Hemphill in the background saying “Let’s do this; let’s go to the Capitol. We did it in Boise.” This remark was found to be in reference to the storming of a legislative session of the Idaho Legislature in August 2020, in which protestors raging against COVID-19 restrictions broke through a glass door at the Statehouse; Hemphill was determined to have participated in this event. On January 6, Hemphill slipped through the barricades set up outside the U.S. Capitol; when law enforcement ordered her to go back behind the barriers, she encouraged others to cross over with her. After the other rioters broke through, Hemphill was at the front of the line opposing the law enforcement officers. She entered the building through the East Rotunda, knowingly and illegally. After walking about the Rotunda for about ten minutes, Hemphill asked an officer to escort her out of the building, allegedly fearful that she would suffer an injury. Afterwards, Hemphill stayed outside the East Rotunda entrance, taking videos of the other rioters until the rest were dispersed.","Charging Documents, Local News, Court Documents"

The first tip, received by the FBI on January 7, 2021, notified them of McGrew's intent to travel to Washington D.C. and protest the ""stolen vote"" prior to the day as well as his belief in some elements of the Qanon conspiracy theory; the second, received on February 26, 2021, provided the FBI with photos of McGrew participating in the violent events and confronting MPD and Capitol Police officers. Law enforcement was able to identify McGrew through bodycam footage when the individual matching his description in the photos lifted his shirt and exposed a tattoo on his torso reading ""King James."" McGrew was known to have that exact tattoo in that exact area as it was shown in a booking photo from a previous arrest. Further footage shows McGrew repeatedly accosting law enforcement officers: he yelled ""we're coming in, whether you like it or not"" and ""fight with us, not against us"" at them directly; later, McGrew was seen within the rotunda lunging at an officer who attempted to forcefully repel the intruders; McGrew continued to disobey the officers' orders to retreat, screaming ""You leave! This is our house!"" and then striking and grabbing for the baton of an officer that attempted to push him back. With plenty of evidence to charge him on, law enforcement began a manhunt for McGrew that tracked him to a sober home he was living in in Carlsbad, California; McGrew was not there--having left for a hearing regarding another crime he committed in Mississippi--but law enforcement did find the clothing that was consistent with that worn by McGrew at the U.S. Capitol in the bodycam footage. Over the next several days, McGrew traveled westward from Mississippi to Arizona and even managed to cross into and out of Mexico; the FBI received a warrant to track McGrew's cell phone. McGrew was eventually found outside his half-sister's home in Glendale, Arizona and subsequently arrested by the FBI.","Charging Documents, Court Documents, Government Reports and Release, News Articles"

Jersey approached the USCP and MPD officers positioned near the Archway of the Lower West Terrace armed with a gnarled stick. After passing this stick off to another rioter, Jersey lunged at one of these MPD officers, grabbing him by the face and bringing him to the ground. Jersey tried to wrestle the officer's baton out of his grasp, but soon found another baton and used the weapon against other officers. As Jersey's attention turned elsewhere, the MPD officer he knocked to the ground was left open to attack by Jersey's co-defendants. The officer's helmet was knocked off, and he ultimately left the incident with a head lacerasion and several abrasions on his body. As his co-defendants were brutalizing the officer, Jersey picked up his helmet and took it for himself. Jersey came to the FBI's attention after he was recognized in photos from the riot that showed him wearing a distinctive blue University of Michigan sweatshirt and a brown jacket. Facebook messages between Jersey and those he traveled to Washington, D.C. with show that he was anticipating violence at the event. The helmet, along with an MPD badge, was found in Jersey's residence by law enforcement officers executing a search warrant later on.","Charging Documents, Court Documents, Local News Articles, Governmental Reports and Release"

McAbee was able to procure some reinforced brass knuckle gloves and an outfit that brandished both his sheriff's patch and a Three Percenters emblem. After attending President Trump's rally at the Ellipse, McAbee proceeded to the U.S. Capitol Building with the mob. After using his phone to film the destruction of barricades on the West Plaza, McAbee went to the Archway of the Lower West Tunnel. There, he dragged a downed MPD officer deeper into the violent mob and then took swings at the other officer who stepped out to help his fallen cohort, striking him while wearing the reinforced brass knuckle gloves. McAbee then lifted up the downed officer, fell down a set of stairs with him, and landed on top of him. McAbee held him down for approximately 20 seconds while other rioters attacked him.

Someone asks a man, “What is your name? Where are you from?” and he replies, “Zeke Stecher from New Jersey,” according to the complaint. The FBI searched New Jersey’s motor vehicle records and found an Ezekiel K.

Agents then conducted an in-person interview with a local Sewell farmer who purchased produce from Stecher who said they’d known him for over 10 years. An agent showed the person still images from the video and the person identified Stecher as the man they know as “Zeke,” the FBI says in the complaint. In all, the FBI described three videos from the attack in which they say Stecher appears. In one, he allegedly appears against the wall of the lower west terrace of the Capitol, pushing the crowd forward, toward Washington D.C. police officers and into the doors of the U.S. Capitol. Stecher is also allegedly seen in a video in which riot shields are taken from officers and passed back by members of the crowd and Stecher is yelling in the direction of the police. In other videos, the FBI says, Stecher is seen multiple times pushing against police as the rioters squeeze and push through a narrow tunnel. At one point, he is sprayed with a chemical irritant but pushes forward, before eventually retreating from the building. He then pours water on his face.""

Prosecutors say that he was already on the radar of law enforcement after a rioter who pleaded guilty identified him as one of the people who lined up with the Oath Keepers the day of the riot. The criminal complaint alleges that he was part of the group that entered into a formation — called a “stack” — in order to force its way into the Capitol. Court documents enumerate many records obtained that show Beeks traveled to Washington, D.C., on the day of the riot, including records from a personal finance app and a rental car agency, as well as cellphone records. Beeks was not wearing the typical camouflage favored by the far-right extremist group, according to court documents, but instead appears in images from that day in a black jacket with the word “Bad” on it in red letters, from Michael Jackson's 1987 world tour. It is that jacket that helped lead law enforcement to him; agents found photographs on Instagram of a person who appears to be Beeks wearing the jacket while posing in front of a sign for the musical play Jesus Christ Superstar. Beeks is an actor who performs as Judas — under the stage name James T. Justis — in the traveling production of the play, and the criminal complaint notes he was observed performing the role in both San Francisco and Los Angeles. In addition, he has also performed as a Michael Jackson impersonator. Prosecutors claim that Beeks changed his phone and phone number the day after an indictment naming co-conspirators was filed and registered his new phone under his stage name. After Beeks was charged, he appeared in court and claimed that the U.S. government had no authority over him — which a U.S. District judge called “gobbledygook.” The production of Jesus Christ Superstar has since replaced him in the role of Judas.

To make sure Biden’s doesn’t become president,” Tim Levon Boughner allegedly posted on social media on Jan. 5, 2021, the day that phone records reportedly indicate he traveled from Michigan to Washington, D.C. For weeks prior, Boughner wrote multiple social media entries questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election and calling Joe Biden “stupid,” according to court records. Boughner first came to the attention of the FBI in the spring of 2021 when FBI agents reviewed police body-worn camera footage that allegedly shows Boughner assaulting an officer with a chemical spray. Subsequently, the FBI issued a BOLO alert for the then-unidentified Boughner. In addition, the volunteer group Sedition Hunters assigned a moniker to the person who federal prosecutors say is Boughner: “#blackpufferwhitescarf."" According to the FBI, Boughner was identified by a tattoo of a five-point star below a dragon on the inside of his left wrist. At the end of July 2021, a search warrant was issued to a Facebook account that matched Boughner. The subscriber data provided by Facebook allegedly confirmed he was indeed at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. On the day of the riot, he allegedly posted: “I grabbed a can from them and started spraying. I got it on video lol …That was wild.

Court documents indicate that Franklin traveled to Washington, D.C., with his friend Thomas Adams Jr., who was charged in April of 2021. The criminal complaint references an article from *Insider,* published the day after the riot, that says Franklin tripped while at the bottom of the Capitol steps and fell onto an officer who he says “barely reacted.” The article reported that Franklin followed a group of people who were climbing scaffolding and entering the building through a window that was smashed. Once inside, Franklin allegedly followed people onto the floor of the Senate and observed “a shirtless man with an animal skin headdress and his face painted red, white, and blue stood at the speaker's chair, wielding a bullhorn, and flexing his biceps” who was presumably Jacob Chansley, also known as the QAnon Shaman. Months after the riot, agents say they tracked Franklin down at his house, executed a search warrant and seized gear that they claim can be seen in images of that day and in particular the footage from the Senate floor: a Trump 2020 Keep America Great flag, a plaid patterned shirt, a pair of Nike shoes and a baseball cap emblazoned with “United States of America” and a flag in the center. During the execution of the search warrant, an FBI agent alleges that he overheard a conversation between Franklin and his significant other. In the conversation, Franklin allegedly admitted that he was in the Capitol building. He also allegedly said, “You had to be there, the whole thing was fun.” (NPR)",Charging Documents

He was arrested this morning in Smithsburg, Maryland and is expected to make his initial appearance later today in the District of Columbia. According to court documents, on Jan. 6, 2021, Miller was among a mob illegally massed on the Lower West Terrace and in an Archway and tunnel that leads into the Capitol Building. At approximately 4:27 p.m., he entered the area near the tunnel. Law enforcement officers had formed a protective line with riot shields at the entrance to the tunnel in efforts to keep the rioters outside. Miller advanced until he was positioned immediately in front of the police line. He then swung and struck a police officer with a long wooden pole. At approximately 4:31 p.m., Miller was positioned on the steps of the Lower West Terrace, holding what appears to be a baton or stick. He threw the item towards the entrance to the tunnel, where a line of police officers was positioned. He then threw at least three other items, including a large audio speaker, at the line of police officers. At approximately 4:33 p.m., Miller again positioned himself immediately in front of the police line. He then swung a large pole or stick multiple times, striking a number of officers in the police line. Shortly thereafter, Miller grabbed a police riot shield which was being held by two police officers, and forcibly pulled the shield away from the officers. Miller took the shield into the crowd on the Lower West Terrace and handed it to another rioter."" (DOJ press release)",Charging Documents

He was arrested on June 13, 2023...According to court documents, on Jan. 6, 2021, McNulty was first seen among the crowd located on the west front of the Capitol building. From there, McNulty scaled the retaining wall to reach the upper west terrace of the U.S. Capitol. In surveillance footage, McNulty can be seen walking from the west side of the U.S. Capitol to the north side at 2:52 p.m. McNulty then followed the terrace around to the north door of U.S. Capitol, where a large group of rioters gathered and attempted to breach into the building...When McNulty approached the north door, he appeared to be affected by a chemical irritant, causing him to turn back to the crowd. As he did so, McNulty raised and pumped his fist into the air. Later, video footage shows an alarm coming from the Capitol building as well as loud music in the crowd. Eventually, some law enforcement officers moved between the rioters and the north door. One officer told the rioters, “Get back, everyone get back.” When the crowd demands that the officer let them into the Capitol building, the same officer responds, “I can’t do that.” McNulty is visible to the right of the officer...Later, additional law enforcement officers arrived to clear the terrace of the rioters. As that happened, McNulty stood in front of the line of officers and violently pushed against one officer’s riot shield multiple times over the course of several seconds. The officer, a member of the Prince George’s County Police Department, was interviewed about the incident after January 6. The officer claimed to distinctly remember the interaction with McNulty as aggressive and persistent. The officer explained that McNulty tried to gain control of their shields and that the officers had to exert increasingly more effort to counter McNulty’s force.""

In August of 2021, the FBI received a package containing a Verizon phone and the message: “THERE IS PHOTO, VIDEO AND OTHER EVIDENCE ON THIS DEVICE THAT IMPLICATES THE OWNER AS A PARTICIPENT [sic] IN THE JANUARY 6, 2021 CAPITOL RIOT.""

In an interview with the FBI, Marroquin admitted to entering the building, court records state. He also said he fell asleep on a train on the way back to his hotel.
